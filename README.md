# Working version.

Requires 2 files:
mta.py is the application
gtfs_realtime_pb2.py is the compiled .proto file

# to do:
- make it generic: input station +/- train and direction
- provide interface to drive display
- make it repeat at intervals (create function to poll time and gtfs and refresh, call at specified interval)
- add vehicle and station alerts
